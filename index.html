            <h3>RX-0</h3>
            <h2>$1,500,000 USD</h2>
            <p>One of our favorite models that comes from our friends overseas is our RX-0 Unicorn. This model was created to be the be-all and end-all of mobile suits. It comes loaded with a multitude of beam powered weapons, Hyper Bazooka, and a <i>Destory Mode</i> which features even more weapons systems, and will allow the suit to glow in all of it various hard points. The Unicorn is for experienced pilots only, we recomend about five years of expierence before you set foot in the Unicorn. This model features the NT-D system, which activates the <i>Destroy Mode</i> and scans the pilots brainwaves continuously, allowing the Unicorn to be pilots completely by thought. The <i>Destory Mode</i> can only be held for five minutes however, before the limiter is engaged and begins administering drugs to help slow the pilots bloodflow back down and the NT-D system shuts down. For our master class pilots, this one's for you!</p>

            <p>We are proud to announce we have just began a project to recreate the famous Nirvash typeTheEnd. This model will come with all weapons systems full operational, and will feature a single-pilot cockpit. This model does not come equiped with a compac drive. <br> The typeTheEnd model has gained cult favorite status throughout the years starting with being the nemisis fo the oringal Nirvash typeZero. The LFOs infrastructure has only changed once, and we will be recreating the original mostly black painted model. <br> This Nirvash is expected to start at $1,000,000, with a improved model starting at $1,500,000, and a customizable, fully-loaded typeTheEnd starting at $2,000,000. <br> Makes sure to check back with us frequently for pictures and update on our new project!</p>
