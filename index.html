            <p>We are proud to announce we have just began a project to recreate the famous Nirvash typeTheEnd. This model will come with all weapons systems full operational, and will feature a single-pilot cockpit. This model does not come equiped with a compac drive. <br> The typeTheEnd model has gained cult favorite status throughout the years starting with being the nemisis fo the oringal Nirvash typeZero. The LFOs infrastructure has only changed once, and we will be recreating the original mostly black painted model. <br> This Nirvash is expected to start at $1,000,000, with a improved model starting at $1,500,000, and a customizable, fully-loaded typeTheEnd starting at $2,000,000. <br> Makes sure to check back with us frequently for pictures and update on our new project!</p>
